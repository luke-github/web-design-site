          <h2>My website</h2>

          <p>
            does this website really have a purpose? no. it would be pretty silly to try to claim that it does. however what it does have is a very cool looking background. and you would never guess what i spent most of my time creating on this site - <b>the background</b>

          <h2>how it started</h2>

          <p>
              well originally i had a completely different site that was supposed to be like a terminal, but then i realized i was completely out of ideas and my site didnt even look that cool, so i decided to switch it up and create this. i had just recently seen a video on a javascript library called <b>threejs</b> and it looked like it would be really cool to use for a dynamic background with a bunch of stuff flying around

          <h2>what i used</h2>

          <p>
            usually the most difficult part of making a smaller sized project is actually setting up the environment youre making it in, but it wasnt too bad for this, since i used a tool called vite which made a bunch of the files for me and then i just added some of my own and got to work, and by work i mean google how to do things i wanted to do.

          <h2>was it very difficult</h2>

          <p>
              it wasnt. a lot of programming is just googling well so overall i was able to just search the things i couldnt figure out on my own. if you spend a few hours learning a bit about a language and then just google the things you dont know how to do, you can make a lot of stuff.

          <h2>the end goal</h2>

          <p>
            i think it would be cool to maintain this site and use it in the future as a portfolio, once i have actually done some more "impressive" things. for now i just wrote all this junk out since i figured that ought to be better than some latin that will just make people ask the meaning of the words.
